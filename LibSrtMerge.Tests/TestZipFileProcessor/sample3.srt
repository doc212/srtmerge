1
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:59,401
We had such, potential.
Such promise.

2
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:04,858
But we squandered our gifts,
our intelligence.

3
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:09,192
Our blind pursuit
of technology...

4
00:01:09,227 --> 00:01:13,491
only sped us quicker
to our doom.

5
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:19,590
Our world is ending...

6
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:23,269
but life must go on.

7
00:05:25,512 --> 00:05:29,182
Wait, I'm a friend.

8
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,279
Yes. I always hoped...

9
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,375
so much thought...

10
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,373
The details, carved wood.

11
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:56,039
Molded copper.

12
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,460
You can't speak?

13
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,426
Ah'ha...

14
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,349
Come with me.

15
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,236
Here. Stop!

16
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:31,636
Some things in this world...

17
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:34,702
are better left
where they lie.

18
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:37,956
But if you know
where to look...

19
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:42,096
these ruins are full of riches.

20
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:46,100
Wait, wait.

21
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:48,003
Almost there.

22
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,384
Friend... friend?

23
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:55,485
- Friend.
- Friend.

24
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:04,410
What's this?

25
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:09,582
You've found it.

26
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:14,087
He's... uh,
he's always drawing this.

27
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:19,968
Are... are we alone?

28
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:21,845
No, no...

29
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,265
Shh...

30
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:29,060
Go.

31
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:36,818
Get in the can, go on.

32
00:07:58,798 --> 00:08:00,300
Huh...

33
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:48,848
Hey, hey, hey...

34
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:54,062
Why don't you finish,
what you started...

35
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:55,855
with me.

36
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:56,583
No, no, no. No.

37
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,259
It's alright.

38
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:01,838
I'm not gonna hurt you.

39
00:10:01,873 --> 00:10:05,133
You're safe now.

40
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:08,726
Where am I?

41
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:13,016
With us. I never expected
to see another one.

42
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:15,441
There... that should hold.

43
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:18,813
If Two were here, he would
have done a better job.

44
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:22,108
- I wonder where he has gone to?
- I was with him.

45
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:24,784
Two? Where, out there?

46
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:28,114
- What did he...?
- Keeping secrets from me, I see?

47
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,201
I was coming to tell you.

48
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:32,917
What's this?

49
00:10:32,952 --> 00:10:37,248
I found him, in the emptiness.

50
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:38,875
What were you doing out there?

51
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,176
You know the beast.

52
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:43,094
How many times have I told you?

53
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:47,133
The Beast? That's what took Two.
If we hurry, we can save him.

54
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,636
The beast took him?
That's the end of it.

55
00:10:49,671 --> 00:10:50,970
But he was still alive.

56
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:53,389
No! We have rules!

57
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:04,324
Our new guest seems confused.

58
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:08,780
Perhaps I can help you
teach some clarity.

59
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:34,347
- It didn't kill him?
- Quiet.

60
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:48,278
Hold on.

61
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:31,279
When we woke in this world...

62
00:12:31,314 --> 00:12:33,204
it was chaos.

63
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:39,579
Man and machine, attacked
each other, with fire and metal.

64
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:52,550
I found others.

65
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:59,641
There's a gap ahead.

66
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:02,769
Follow me.

67
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:16,593
The gas...
killed, everything.

68
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:20,200
I led us here...

69
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,105
to sanctuary.

70
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,518
And here we waited
for the war to end.

71
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:28,935
Slowly the world, became silent.

72
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,317
The only thing
that remains now...

73
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:34,652
is the beast.

74
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:37,078
So, we stay hidden...

75
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:41,374
and we wait for it to...
to sleep.

76
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:44,621
But where did it come from?
Why is it hunting us?

77
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,671
Questions like that,
are pointless.

78
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:50,293
We need to protect ourselves.
Keep ourselves out of danger.

79
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:54,547
Too many of us
have already been lost.

80
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,426
But he isn't lost.

81
00:14:58,468 --> 00:15:02,472
- Why aren't you listening to me?
- Two, chose his own path!

82
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:07,018
I suggest you avoid
making the same mistake.

83
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,947
Go to the watch tower...

84
00:15:12,982 --> 00:15:16,736
and take our guest, with you.

85
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:21,593
This was the first thing
we built together.

86
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:25,054
- We can still go after him?
- Us?

87
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:28,016
But he could be anywhere
out there.

88
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:33,445
Ah, that's where it took him.

89
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,315
Down towards those
three tall shapes.

90
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:41,738
Oh, no! We can't!
Not there.

91
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:43,990
We have rules.

92
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:50,622
- Why'd you listen to One?
- A group must have a leader.

93
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:53,333
But what if he's wrong?

94
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:57,844
Come with me.

95
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,048
I can't do it alone.

96
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,091
I...

97
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:05,345
I... I can't.

98
00:17:05,386 --> 00:17:07,061
But...

99
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:09,891
Wouldn't he have come for you?

100
00:17:24,572 --> 00:17:26,991
Wait.

101
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:34,374
We're going to need a map.

102
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,968
Actually, I don't mind having one eye.

103
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:43,341
It's easier for me. I can concentrate
on one thing at a time. You know?

104
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:10,285
Why was he out here alone?

105
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:32,765
- Where's this tunnel?
- I don't know.

106
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:37,395
Wait!

107
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:50,325
We should go back.

108
00:18:51,784 --> 00:18:53,953
We can't.

109
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,425
The, beast.

110
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:12,222
It's too dark.

111
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:18,436
We can use that.

112
00:19:47,006 --> 00:19:49,259
Wait.

113
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,944
Two, would be impressed.

114
00:20:12,073 --> 00:20:14,617
We'll find him.

115
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:25,628
You know, you're just like him. You
forget to remember, to be scared.

116
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,694
Can I wait here?

117
00:21:05,793 --> 00:21:09,589
Why would he bring him here?

118
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:54,634
Two!

119
00:21:56,553 --> 00:21:58,930
Two!

120
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:12,360
I knew you would come.

121
00:22:12,443 --> 00:22:14,779
I thought...?

122
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:52,650
Dirty thing.

123
00:23:40,865 --> 00:23:43,952
- Seven?
- I don't believe it.

124
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:59,050
- You've come back.
- I never left.

125
00:23:59,217 --> 00:24:02,303
You've finally decided
to join the fight.

126
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:08,893
You dropped this.

127
00:24:09,185 --> 00:24:10,693
Where have you been hiding?

128
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:15,859
Rusty and hectic gathered,
shiny pile of scrap.

129
00:24:18,778 --> 00:24:20,572
Ohh...

130
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:25,785
You did it, friend.

131
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:28,079
I never thought...

132
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:50,977
Wait. What're you doing?

133
00:24:51,227 --> 00:24:54,147
You don't even know
what it is.

134
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,705
No! Two!

135
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,628
Jump!

136
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,243
Hurry, quick.

137
00:27:16,623 --> 00:27:18,791
What're you waiting for?

138
00:27:19,918 --> 00:27:21,544
Keep running.

139
00:27:22,045 --> 00:27:24,130
Come on.

140
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:49,656
I knew we should't have come.
Why? Why did you do that?

141
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:52,826
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

142
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:57,497
I'm sorry.

143
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:03,545
What were you thinking?

144
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:13,012
What's it going to do?

145
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:15,557
I know where we can
find answers.

146
00:29:26,628 --> 00:29:30,507
Is this, what it was like?

147
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:35,845
Keep up.

148
00:30:01,037 --> 00:30:06,334
Oh, they've been here,
the whole time?

149
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:09,295
Twins.

150
00:30:09,462 --> 00:30:12,924
They've been hiding here,
lost in the past.

151
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:15,301
Looking for answers.

152
00:30:19,013 --> 00:30:21,391
They're cataloguing.

153
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,620
We need your help.

154
00:30:35,655 --> 00:30:40,034
- We awakened, something.
- No, I awakened, something.

155
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:42,871
Something terrible.

156
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:52,881
That's it!

157
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:33,171
Today, the, chancellor presented
the latest advancement...

158
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:35,632
of technological wizardry
to the public.

159
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:37,724
Comrades!

160
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,011
Today begins a new era.

161
00:31:40,887 --> 00:31:44,015
Let us praise
this new technology.

162
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:48,812
Welcome, to the age
of the machine.

163
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:52,524
It will make new machines,
in it's own image.

164
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,491
Machines of peace.

165
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:57,445
Letting us know
the glorious new era...

166
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,365
of wealth and prosperity
for the state.

167
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:13,086
Governors are advised to pause,
for a public address.

168
00:32:14,462 --> 00:32:18,341
Science has turned
it's sinister eyes against us.

169
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:21,886
People of our mighty state.

170
00:32:23,346 --> 00:32:28,643
Join me in repelling
the iron fist of the machine.

171
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:44,200
But the thing that woke it,
it... it was round and...

172
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:47,620
and engraved
with strange shapes.

173
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:54,259
The shapes corresponded.

174
00:32:54,294 --> 00:32:57,797
It fit perfectly,
into the machine.

175
00:32:57,832 --> 00:33:00,592
I think it was made for it.

176
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,511
That's what Six, always draws.

177
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:05,103
Six?

178
00:33:05,138 --> 00:33:08,099
Two, collected his drawings.

179
00:33:08,134 --> 00:33:11,060
He was always studying them.

180
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:15,523
- I have to see them.
- What?

181
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:17,782
Go back to, One?

182
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:21,946
So he can lock us away,
while this nightmare awakens?

183
00:33:22,155 --> 00:33:24,699
Never.

184
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:53,895
Alright... alright,
where did he put them?

185
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,230
Here somewhere.

186
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:58,166
Here. Here.

187
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:00,068
There they are.

188
00:34:00,103 --> 00:34:02,612
Right?

189
00:34:08,952 --> 00:34:11,788
You awakened, what?

190
00:34:11,823 --> 00:34:13,963
You fools.

191
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:16,633
- I warned you.
- He warned you.

192
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:19,719
Now you've awoke
unimaginable, terror.

193
00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:25,218
And may I ask, did you manage
to save, Two? Of course not.

194
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:26,893
By following this wickless fool,

195
00:34:26,928 --> 00:34:29,312
you've endangered everything
we've worked for.

196
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:33,143
- Why was Two sent out, to begin with?
- I sent him. To scout.

197
00:34:33,178 --> 00:34:34,484
That doesn't make any sense.

198
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:37,543
You don't send
the oldest out to... Look...

199
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:40,567
we need to figure out,
what's going on.

200
00:34:40,602 --> 00:34:44,362
The source... The source...

201
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:49,242
Go back, to the source...

202
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:53,246
This is it! This is what
wakened the machine.

203
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:56,624
What do you know about this?

204
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,843
Now you can't be trusted.

205
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:02,589
I wont allow you,
to endanger us further.

206
00:35:02,624 --> 00:35:04,465
Subjugate them.

207
00:35:04,507 --> 00:35:07,760
- Sub... What?
- You illiterate crimp...

208
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:10,013
Take their belongings.

209
00:35:13,683 --> 00:35:16,019
- Hey...
- Wait!

210
00:35:20,982 --> 00:35:24,736
You're nothing but a coward.

211
00:35:26,946 --> 00:35:29,164
How dare you challenge me?

212
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,333
I, who kept everyone safe
all these years.

213
00:35:32,368 --> 00:35:35,914
Ever since you got here,
everything has been unravelling.

214
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:38,381
You're a curse! A fool.

215
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:42,587
- Guided by pointless queries.
- And you... are a blind man.

216
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:45,256
Guided by fear.

217
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:54,140
Sometimes fear...
is the appropriate response.

218
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:12,075
No-o-o!...

219
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:25,421
- Nine!
- Go!

220
00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:41,146
- Nine!
- Keep going, I'll find a way down.

221
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:28,651
Come on.

222
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:27,502
Let me try that again.

223
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:35,844
The cable! Pull it!

224
00:38:48,898 --> 00:38:51,568
Grab on.

225
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:03,746
Grab the wire.

226
00:39:19,012 --> 00:39:22,807
Your cape... let it go.

227
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:24,993
I can't.

228
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:27,145
Do it now!

229
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,247
It's only a cape.

230
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:46,576
There will be more,
wont there?

231
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:49,162
Yes.

232
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:51,894
It's not safe here.

233
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:54,209
Stand look out.

234
00:41:58,922 --> 00:42:02,634
I'll search out a safer retreat.

235
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:21,420
- What... what is it?
- The source.

236
00:43:21,455 --> 00:43:24,507
That thing
that woke the machine.

237
00:43:24,716 --> 00:43:27,802
- Go back, go back.
- Back to where?

238
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:29,894
Dark science.

239
00:43:29,929 --> 00:43:34,309
What good does this useless
rubbish do us? Forget it!

240
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:35,911
You know something.

241
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,444
What do you know?

242
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:40,607
I know enough, to leave their
ancient evil to moulder.

243
00:43:40,642 --> 00:43:43,085
Look what they've left us with.

244
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,528
Leave it be I say.
But you...

245
00:43:45,563 --> 00:43:47,287
always asking questions.

246
00:43:47,322 --> 00:43:50,909
So many pointless questions...
Probing, pushing.

247
00:43:50,944 --> 00:43:54,621
Like, Two, he always
had to know, so much.

248
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:57,624
I was right, you did
send him out to die.

249
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:00,627
He was old, he was weak.

250
00:44:01,211 --> 00:44:05,256
Sometimes one must be sacrificed
for the good of many.

251
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:08,176
You, coward!

252
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:12,388
Seven.

253
00:44:26,236 --> 00:44:30,406
Your path
takes us to catastrophe.

254
00:44:36,454 --> 00:44:40,479
- We have to go back.
- Back? Where?

255
00:44:40,514 --> 00:44:44,504
To the first room,
where I woke.

256
00:45:39,142 --> 00:45:42,562
Can't he see, his way
only brings trouble...

257
00:45:42,597 --> 00:45:45,440
I mean what good
comes from his part?

258
00:45:47,317 --> 00:45:51,321
I know what we need, right now.
I know what's right.

259
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:53,406
Huh?

260
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:55,909
No.

261
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,625
Huh...

262
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:18,556
No, no, you can't be.

263
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,267
No, no!

264
00:46:26,898 --> 00:46:28,900
Find them.

265
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:12,485
Don't look in the eyes.

266
00:47:23,538 --> 00:47:26,332
Five!

267
00:47:47,729 --> 00:47:50,565
- Seven!
- Nine!

268
00:48:12,504 --> 00:48:15,256
- We have to go after them.
- What?

269
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:19,260
- Eight? Wher... where's, Eight?
- That thing has them.

270
00:48:19,295 --> 00:48:21,971
It's taking them back
to the machine.

271
00:48:22,222 --> 00:48:24,557
Then it's too late.

272
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:26,747
Wait, wait,
we have to get outta here.

273
00:48:26,782 --> 00:48:28,812
We must try to find
another safe place.

274
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:30,278
No more hiding.

275
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:33,942
We're going after them!
All of us.

276
00:48:34,025 --> 00:48:38,780
Need I remind you, on the outcome
of your last heroic venture?

277
00:48:52,085 --> 00:48:55,004
I can't let this
happen to them.

278
00:50:19,172 --> 00:50:22,967
- I'm going in.
- I'm coming with you.

279
00:50:23,009 --> 00:50:26,721
No... I need you here.

280
00:50:27,138 --> 00:50:29,891
If I don't make it back...

281
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:33,186
destroy it.

282
00:50:36,689 --> 00:50:40,443
Wait, How?

283
00:50:50,203 --> 00:50:56,251
Come on, then. Let's hear it,
what's your... brilliant scheme?

284
00:50:57,794 --> 00:51:00,547
We'll need a full barrel.

285
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:11,075
Hey! Over here!

286
00:52:57,664 --> 00:53:01,090
- Where are they?
- It's been too long.

287
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:05,421
- We have to do it now!
- No, they need more time.

288
00:53:10,009 --> 00:53:12,595
Help me pull it down.

289
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:45,295
- They're coming. They're coming!
- Help.

290
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,881
Help.

291
00:53:48,923 --> 00:53:52,051
No! Not yet.

292
00:53:52,135 --> 00:53:56,764
- Let go, you fool.
- Five!

293
00:53:56,799 --> 00:53:58,892
We're coming!

294
00:53:58,927 --> 00:54:00,894
Now!

295
00:55:23,977 --> 00:55:26,646
Good riddance.

296
00:55:27,814 --> 00:55:30,400
It's done.

297
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,331
Thank you.

298
00:57:29,561 --> 00:57:36,818
The machine, everybody!
The machine! It's still alive!

299
00:57:40,947 --> 00:57:43,158
No!

300
00:57:44,242 --> 00:57:47,162
There's nothing we can do.

301
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:53,501
Help!

302
00:57:54,294 --> 00:57:58,089
Please! No, no!

303
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:01,009
No!

304
00:58:10,685 --> 00:58:14,397
It's not.

305
00:58:17,025 --> 00:58:18,985
To the bridge!

306
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:31,080
No! They're trapped!
They're trapped inside.

307
00:58:31,115 --> 00:58:34,542
Six, come on!
Get on the bridge.

308
00:58:52,727 --> 00:58:55,772
No, stop!
You mustn't destroy it.

309
00:58:55,807 --> 00:58:56,863
Get away, Six!

310
00:58:56,898 --> 00:58:59,108
You mustn't destroy it.
Don't destroy it.

311
00:58:59,143 --> 00:59:01,273
They're trapped,
they're trapped!

312
00:59:01,308 --> 00:59:03,404
They're inside,
they're inside!

313
00:59:16,543 --> 00:59:18,419
Come on.

314
00:59:23,508 --> 00:59:27,220
Go back, to the first room!

315
00:59:27,255 --> 00:59:30,932
He'll show you. The source.

316
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:52,557
- It must be destroyed.
- No, no we can't.

317
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:55,665
Didn't you hear him?
They're trapped inside.

318
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,310
- We can still save them.
- What?

319
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:00,920
- How?
- We have to find the source.

320
01:00:00,955 --> 01:00:03,173
It holds the answers.

321
01:00:04,424 --> 01:00:08,219
- We need to destroy it.
- But there's still a chance.

322
01:00:12,182 --> 01:00:15,310
We're out of time.

323
01:00:15,768 --> 01:00:17,068
Nine...

324
01:00:17,103 --> 01:00:19,689
they're gone.

325
01:00:20,482 --> 01:00:22,901
You are wrong.

326
01:00:23,401 --> 01:00:27,947
- Nine...
- Let him go.

327
01:01:30,552 --> 01:01:33,353
Greetings, Nine.

328
01:01:33,388 --> 01:01:37,649
It had such promise,
my great machine.

329
01:01:37,684 --> 01:01:41,646
It was meant to be
an instrument of progress.

330
01:01:41,938 --> 01:01:43,905
Of creation...

331
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:49,195
that was the agreement our,
chancellor failed to honour.

332
01:01:49,863 --> 01:01:54,200
But the fault is hardly
his alone to bear.

333
01:01:54,284 --> 01:01:58,955
The machine was born
purely of my intellect.

334
01:01:59,038 --> 01:02:04,259
Which I now know,
was not enough.

335
01:02:04,294 --> 01:02:09,924
My creation was hopelessly
flawed and indeed dangerous.

336
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:13,059
It lacked a human soul.

337
01:02:13,094 --> 01:02:17,515
And could easily be corrupted
by those who controlled it.

338
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:20,994
That is why,
I'm making each of you.

339
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:25,758
You're all that's left,
of humanity.

340
01:02:25,793 --> 01:02:30,487
You... are all the pieces
of my soul.

341
01:02:31,571 --> 01:02:37,118
Together, you and this device,
shall protect the future.

342
01:02:37,285 --> 01:02:44,042
Look closely and remember...
what you see.

343
01:04:12,964 --> 01:04:15,008
Fire!

344
01:04:15,425 --> 01:04:17,469
No!

345
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:29,731
I now know the truth!

346
01:04:30,231 --> 01:04:32,365
The scientist.

347
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,029
It's the scientist.
He's the source.

348
01:04:36,196 --> 01:04:38,531
He gave us his soul.

349
01:04:38,656 --> 01:04:41,868
We are him.

350
01:04:46,873 --> 01:04:48,798
Load the cannon.

351
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:52,086
Stop!
You'll destroy the talisman.

352
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,299
It's too late.

353
01:05:33,044 --> 01:05:35,338
Quick, quick get in.

354
01:05:37,757 --> 01:05:40,260
We need to take the talisman
above the machine.

355
01:05:40,295 --> 01:05:43,103
It can be used against it.
Lower it to me.

356
01:05:43,138 --> 01:05:47,058
- Then you'll have a chance.
- Enough, Nine, don't do this.

357
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,144
- What if you're wrong?
- I'll show you how to use it.

358
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,729
It'll be okay.

359
01:05:54,232 --> 01:05:56,568
This is the sequence.

360
01:06:32,937 --> 01:06:35,029
No!

361
01:06:35,064 --> 01:06:38,610
Please, we can't do this
without you.

362
01:06:39,736 --> 01:06:42,245
They all died because of me.

363
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,742
I started this,
and now I need to finish it.

364
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,914
They left us nothing.

365
01:06:50,949 --> 01:06:52,624
Nothing.

366
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:56,544
Why do we have to
right their wrongs?

367
01:06:56,711 --> 01:07:01,299
Sometimes,
one must be sacrificed.

368
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,095
No!

369
01:08:13,872 --> 01:08:16,541
You did it.

370
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:21,421
No... I didn't.

371
01:08:22,338 --> 01:08:24,090
Not yet.

372
01:08:36,227 --> 01:08:38,271
Photo log in.

373
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:22,727
They're free now.

374
01:11:51,798 --> 01:11:54,676
What happens next?

375
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:57,519
I'm not sure, exactly.

376
01:11:57,554 --> 01:12:00,890
But this world is ours now.

377
01:12:01,224 --> 01:12:04,060
It's what we make of it.
