1
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,692
l have sailed the world
Beheld its wonders

2
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:59,322
From the Dardanelles
To the mountains of Peru

3
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,618
But there's no place like London

4
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:07,747
No, there's no place like London

5
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,290
Mr. Todd?

6
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:14,795
You are young
Life has been kind to you

7
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:22,553
You will learn

8
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,403
There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit

9
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,364
And the vermin of the world inhabit it

10
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,491
And its morals aren't worth
what a pig could spit

11
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,118
And it goes by the name of London

12
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,288
At the top of the hole
sit a privileged few

13
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,290
Making mock of the vermin
in the lower zoo

14
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,125
Turning beauty into filth and greed

15
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,547
l too have sailed the world
and seen its wonders

16
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:03,135
For the cruelty of men
is as wondrous as Peru

17
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,556
But there's no place like London

18
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,868
ls everything all right, Mr. Todd?

19
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,455
l beg your indulgence, Anthony.

20
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,291
My mind is far from easy.

21
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:41,424
ln these once familiar streets
l feel shadows everywhere.

22
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,050
Shadows?

23
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,886
Ghosts.

24
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,689
There was a barber and his wife

25
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,734
And she was beautiful
