1
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,760
That's interesting advice,
coming from a slave owner.

2
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,280
Men have enslaved each other...

3
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,560
since they invented gods
to forgive them for doing it.

4
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,160
I've seen Jews build Egypt's glory.

5
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,480
<i>Seen Christians...</i>

6
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,040
<i>thrown to lions with my own eyes.</i>

7
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,680
<i>And I've seen Africans</i>
<i>sell their own kind to Europeans.</i>

8
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:46,760
<i>May I share one of the revelations</i>
<i>of my 5,000 years?</i>

9
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,520
We're all slaves to something.

10
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,880
I, to eternity.

11
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,240
You, to your convictions.
Others, to the color of their skin.

12
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,200
All I ever wanted...

13
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,080
was to see my kind
granted their rightful place.

14
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,280
But there are those of us,
those like your friend Henry...

15
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,000
who enjoy living in the dark.

16
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,280
And as you're doubtless aware...

17
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,520
I cannot personally destroy him,
nor he I.

18
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,920
You, Mr. Lincoln...

19
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,800
you could eliminate those
last pockets of resistance...

20
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,680
beginning with Henry Sturges himself.

21
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,440
All I ask...

22
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,720
is for you to break your chains.

23
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,560
Kill your master.

24
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,480
Be free.

25
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,880
And if I refuse?

26
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,720
Then you go on your merry way.

27
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,920
After I make you one of us, and...

28
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,440
spoon-feed you your friend.

29
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,440
Now, a simple "yes" or "no"
will suffice.

30
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,240
Kill Henry...

31
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,680
save your friend.

32
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,560
Feel free to take your time to decide.
Five...

33
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,840
four...

34
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,040
three...

35
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,680
two...

36
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,720
one.

37
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,840
Come on!

38
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,760
This way.

39
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,520
Miss Tubman, Miss Tubman.
We've been waiting for you.

40
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,920
Come quickly.
